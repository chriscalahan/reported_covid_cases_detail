# Data Exploration of a dataset that is updated weekly by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (obtained from healthdata.gov).

The dataset shows state-aggregated data for hospital utilization in a time-series format dating back to January 1, 2020. It contains almost 77,000 rows and 135 fields on many COVID-19-related utilizations.
To name a few, data captured dives into bed availability, COVID-19 cases (confirmed and suspected), groupings by age group and geographic location, staff shortages, death statistics, and much more.

The goal of my analysis was to explore and identify any key relationships between the various fields. While uncovering several interesting metrics, my final visual assessment focused primarily on COVID-19 cases and reported deaths from the vantage point of age and location.

All SQL code is available for review, both the data cleansing scripts and exploratory analysis. I've also included the original datasets and a data dictionary. Finally, I've provided an image of the final dashboard created in Tableau, as well as the Tableau file.
